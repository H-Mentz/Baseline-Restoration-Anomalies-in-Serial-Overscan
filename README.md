# overscan_analysis

This code is for a primary assessment of overscan anomalies that appear in flat images with long exposure times. In my analysis I compare E2V and ITL sensors as well as images with different exposure times from various flat-pair runs. I use heat-maps to represent the ADU count for the main image and overscan regions for a given sensor. Examples of anomalous behaviors that appear in high flux flats can be described as “smearing” of variable charge in both the serial overscan and the main imaging region in addition to the absence of the parallel overscan for exposure times ~ >300 seconds. 

My observations of the data raise the following questions:
1. What causes the distortions in the serial overscan for longer exposure times?
2. Why is the parallel overscan absent to varying degrees?


Also this github folder is Code Backup for: 
errorbars for pixel number vs ADU count;
histograms pertaining to pixel value in overscan; 
heat-maps that describe the ADU counts for an entire sensor
