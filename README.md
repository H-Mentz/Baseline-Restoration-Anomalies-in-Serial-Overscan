# overscan_analysis

Finding, diagnosing, and understanding incongruous patterns is critical for accurate overscan-correction in future LSST images. This code is used for an assessment of overscan anomalies that appear in flat images with long exposure times. 

Additionally, this github folder is Code Backup for: 
errorbars for pixel number vs ADU count;
histograms pertaining to pixel value in overscan; 
heat-maps that describe the ADU counts for an entire sensor
